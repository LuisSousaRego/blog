# The old smartphone
In August 2017 I bought a [Motorola Moto G5](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g5-8454.php).
I used it daily for almost 3 years before switching to a new phone.
There were a few reasons for this.
In terms of hardware: the screen size was smaller than I would like, storage space was limited for all the apps and pictures, and battery life became annoyingly short by lasting just less than one day.

However the decisive factor for the change was not on the hardware shortcomings.
It was the reason I suspect most people have when buying new phones but everyone is ashamed of admitting.
The phone felt old.
There were no new Android updates anymore, everyone around me had the new and shiny Android release but I was stuck on version 8.1.
Furthermore the last security update was on the 1st February 2019, less than 2 years after the phone was released.
What happens after that is security vulnerabilities pilling up.
Every month there are new ways someone can mess with your phone and it never gets better, it is kind of scary.
Using the phone started to feel like handling a dangerous piece of abandoned ancient technology.

If I wanted to keep using the phone, I would have to fix its problems.
Regarding hardware, apart from getting a new battery, changing the screen size is not possible and increasing storage space sounds too complex for me.
But I could live with such limitations. 
Besides, buying a new battery is easy enough.

What I didn't know at the time, was that fixing the real problem: old software, does have a practical solution.
Introducing LineageOS.

# LineageOS
[LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) is a free and open-source Android distribution with focus on security and longevity. 
It aims to provide a normal Android experience with regular security updates and a few additional features such as customization and useful tools and utilities.
This means that you can replace your android phone's stock OS with LineageOS and enjoy the benefits of a continually updated phone.
Both feature and security wise.

At the time I am writing the project already supports [more than 160 devices](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/) from over 20 vendors. 
One of such devices is my old smartphone.
