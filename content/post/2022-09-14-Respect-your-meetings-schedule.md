Following schedules leads to higher quality meetings.

This might be obvious for a lot of people, but it wasn't exactly for me. 
I grew up in a country where an agreed upon hour isn't an exact point in time but more of a rough estimate. 
When two people say they will meet at 11:00, what is really meant is that they will meet at *around* 11:00. 
There is this unspoken grace period in which any of them are allowed to arrive, effectively late, without expecting any consequence. 
This is true for both formal and informal meetings and the length of the grace period is completely subjective and different for each person. 
It depends on the person, their relationship with whom they are meeting and the meeting's purpose. 
In my experience it can range from around ten minutes to a couple of hours.

It is hard to explain how someone knows how late they can arrive, everything works at the border between conscious and subconscious levels. 
When I look at the clock and roughly see what time it is, I get a feeling that makes me act accordingly.
In some situations it feels like I should hurry up, in others feels like I can relax a bit and take my time to get there. 
But there rarely is a precise time calculation to determine exactly how many minutes I have left, or at what exact time I expect to be there. 
It is all by feel.

You might think I just have a lack of respect for everyone else, but that is not true, this is a cultural issue that is baked into society. 
As a real life example: in both universities I studied in, classes are scheduled to start at the hour, but there is an official tolerance period of ten minutes in one case and fifteen minutes in the other. 
This means that for a class with the standard duration of one hour, both students and professors are expected to miss up to a quarter of it. 
And it does in fact happen like this, most people arrive during the tolerance period, professors included, sometimes even just after. 
During this time, whoever has already arrived casually waits for everyone else, including the professors themselves who, if arrived earlier, stand by until enough students gather or they consider it is late enough and start the class. 
I myself would frequently arrive ten to fifteen minutes late, it was just natural.


(problema das merdas comecarem sempre tarde porque os atrasaos acumulam. E a questao de nao haver hora de fim, entao tudo arrasta indefinidamente, nao ha foco nem priorizacao)
