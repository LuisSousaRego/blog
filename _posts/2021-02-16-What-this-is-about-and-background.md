title: "What this is about"

I've been trying to take a more organized and methodical approach to my life. Starting a blog seemed a logical path to take, it will force me to organize my thoughts and ideas well enough to write about them, as well as to bring projects to an end so they can be shared with everybody else. Just the fact that this article is online must be a good indication that writing may bring some benefits.

I'll be showing off pet projects I've finished and describe the path I took to create them, with all the fun and excitement that comes with the fallible nature of software development. The idea of documenting what I make sounds very appealing, it will allow me to look back and see my skill development clearly.

That doesn't mean I'll always stick to it, it's very likely I'll end up writing about something I am learning or some subject on which I'll believe my opinion is worth sharing. The only thing I'm certain about is that most things will be computer science related. It is a big part of my life and the only one I plan on sharing.
